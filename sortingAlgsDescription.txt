Bubble Sort - A sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the array, comparing adjacent elements 
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, putting the largest element at the end in every iteration. 

Insertion Sort - A sorting algorithm that sorts the array by putting one element at the sorted position in 
every iteration. The smallest element in every iteration is brought to the correct position, moving the element 
downwards if its smaller than its previous elements.

Merge Sort - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves and sorts 
each half recursively (eventually leaving an array with one element that is sorted by definition), and then 
merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

Heap Sort - A sorting algorithm that builds a binary heap and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from 
the heap and puts it at the end of the array until the array is sorted. It is an in-place algorithm since binary
heap is represented as an array.

Selection Sort - A sorting algorithm that iterates through an array and repeatedly selects the minimum element from 
the unsorted portion of the array and puts it in its place until the entire array is sorted.

Quick Sort - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element from the input array and partitions all remaining 
elements into sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively applies 
quick sort on the partitions (until partitions are singleton arrays) and combines them to produce the final sorted array.
