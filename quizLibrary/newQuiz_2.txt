Image=""
Choice_1="Bubble Sort"
Choice_2="Selection Sort"
Choice_3="Insertion Sort"
Choice_4="Merge Sort"
Answer="1"
Explanation="Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) which makes it the least efficient sorting algorithm. Though Selection Sort and Insertion Sort also have time complexity of O(n^2), Bubble Sort has comparison times."
