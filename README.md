# Scenarios
###  Introduction:
The tool being proposed is a sorting algorithm visualisation program. Its purpose is to inform and educate the audience on how sorting algorithms function and reinforce the knowledge presented through a quizzing system. The target audience of this tool is beginner coders, likely to be high school students, who have been recently introduced to sorting algorithms. The reasoning for this target audience is a possible lapse in or lack of understanding of the sorting algorithms and the steps that it takes, a phase that we, as computer science students, have previously experienced. As such, the tool serves to help the user visualise the sorting algorithm through a step by step process, with each step highlighted and explained, while the quizzing system serves to strengthen their understanding and ensure that any misunderstandings are identified and subsequently handled. Our aim is for students using this tool to build a strong intuitive understanding of sorting algorithms.
### Framework and language:
Python3: A high-level, general-purpose programming language.  
Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.   
Figma: A web UI design tool which works with Tkinter.
